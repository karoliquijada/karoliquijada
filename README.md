<h1 align="left">Hi 👋, I'm Karoli</h1>

<h3 align="left">📄 About me</h3>
<hr>

Hey, welcome to my github. I'm a web developer who (kind of) loves Javascript. My first language is Spanish but as you can see I'm proficient in English. I love learning new things and working on solving challenges. At the moment, I'm working on getting my degree as a **Computer Engineer**  (almost done!!) and at the same time taking courses to improve my skills as a developer.

Right now my focus is on Frontend Web Development, but in the future I would like to explore AI and DevOps.
